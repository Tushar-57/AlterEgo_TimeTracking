# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Ecosystem is a single-user personal assistant application designed to help users manage their daily tasks and activities from morning to night. The system leverages multiple specialized AI agents coordinated by LangGraph to provide personalized assistance, maintain user preferences through an interactive knowledge base, and integrate with Google services. The application emphasizes self-help and consistency, empowering users to stay on track with their goals through intelligent automation, human-in-the-loop interactions, and both web and Telegram bot interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with AI agents through text-based interfaces, so that I can get help in a familiar and accessible way.

3. WHEN using mobile or different devices THEN the system SHALL support both dark and light mode themes
4. WHEN needing quick interactions THEN the system SHALL provide a Telegram bot for notifications and simple commands
5. WHEN communicating THEN the system SHALL only support English language input and output

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want multiple specialized AI agents to coordinate and help me throughout my day, so that I can efficiently manage different aspects of my life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create specialized agents covering key life domains (productivity, health, finance, scheduling, journaling, and general assistance)
2. WHEN I interact with the system THEN a main orchestrator agent SHALL handle my requests and coordinate with specialized agents

4. WHEN handling recurring tasks THEN agents SHALL adapt intelligently without requiring manual scheduling setup
5. WHEN analyzing my progress THEN agents SHALL provide analytics and insights with optimization suggestions
6. WHEN I need help THEN the system SHALL route my request to the most appropriate specialized agent

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an interactive knowledge base that learns my preferences, so that I can see what the system knows about me and get personalized assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with agents THEN the system SHALL store my preferences and patterns in a knowledge base
2. WHEN I want to review my data THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visibility into what's stored about me
3. WHEN I need to make changes THEN the system SHALL allow me to view and edit my preferences through the UI
4. WHEN agents need context THEN the system SHALL use RAG-based retrieval for context-aware responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to integrate with Google services for data management, so that I can use familiar tools while maintaining control over my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to Google Sheets THEN the system SHALL establish secure authenticated connections
2. WHEN reading or updating data THEN the system SHALL require human-in-the-loop approval for all modifications
3. WHEN Google Sheets is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fallback to an in-app sheet component
4. WHEN managing my schedule THEN the system SHALL integrate with Google Calendar for scheduling tasks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to help me maintain consistency in my routines and celebrate my progress, so that I can build better habits and stay motivated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set goals or routines THEN the system SHALL track my progress and adherence
2. WHEN I miss routines THEN the system SHALL provide reminders via web app and Telegram bot
3. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL intelligently suggest adjustments and optimizations
4. WHEN I achieve milestones THEN the system SHALL celebrate achievements and provide weekly reports with simple charts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a single user, I want a locally-deployable system with scalable architecture, so that I have control over my data and can expand the system later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL use FastAPI for backend services with local-first deployment
2. WHEN orchestrating workflows THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph for agent coordination
3. WHEN searching preferences THEN the system SHALL use FAISS for efficient vector-based retrieval
4. WHEN monitoring system behavior THEN the system SHALL integrate with LangSmith for debugging and observability

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a journal agent to help me reflect on my daily experiences and track my personal growth, so that I can maintain self-awareness and emotional well-being.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to reflect THEN the journal agent SHALL provide guided prompts for daily, weekly, and monthly reflections
2. WHEN it's my preferred reflection time THEN the system SHALL send gentle reminders via web app and Telegram bot
3. WHEN I complete reflections THEN the system SHALL store insights and patterns for future reference
4. WHEN reviewing my progress THEN the journal agent SHALL help me identify growth patterns and celebrate achievements
5. WHEN other agents need emotional context THEN the journal agent SHALL share relevant insights to improve their assistance

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose between OpenAI and local Ollama models for AI processing, so that I can control costs and data privacy according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN I SHALL be able to toggle between OpenAI API and local Ollama models
2. WHEN using OpenAI THEN I SHALL be able to securely input my API key and select from available models
3. WHEN using Ollama THEN the system SHALL connect to my local Ollama instance and use specified models
4. WHEN my primary provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to the backup provider if configured
5. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity and agent functionality

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want basic security and privacy protection, so that my personal data remains safe without complex compliance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria
